# Schedule_Helper
Python program that parses a text file to find a certain class and/or section and prints results to screen.


In the current version, the GUI is not set up to receive input from user. A "Go" button is present that should be clicked as to see results. The current class that the user is searching for can be modified by changing the "subject" variable to the 4 letter abreviation for any class. The user must also download the desired pdf from http://web-as.tamu.edu/gradereport/ and save it as raw_pdf.
