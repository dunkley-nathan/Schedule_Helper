# Schedule_Helper
Python program that parses a text file to find a certain class and/or section and prints results to screen.


In the current version, the GUI is set up to accept input from the user as long as the current pdf in the working directory contains the class or subject the user wants.The user must download the desired pdf from http://web-as.tamu.edu/gradereport/ and save it as raw_pdf. pdftotext.exe must also be downloaded and placed in the same directory as the schedule.py. It is used to transfer text from a pdf file to text file and is called internally through the code.
